        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The espresso, also known as a short black, is approximately 1 oz. of
            highly concentrated coffee. Although simple in appearance, it can be
            difficult to master.

        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The red eye's purpose is to add a boost of caffeine to your standard
            cup of coffee.

        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The black eye is just the doubled version of the red eye and is very
            high in caffeine.

        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            Americanos are popular breakfast drinks and thought to have
            originated during World War II. Soldiers would add water to their
            coffee to extend their rations farther. The water dilutes the
            espresso while still maintaining a high level of caffeine.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Long Black</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The long black is a similar coffee drink to the americano, but it
            originated in New Zealand and Australia. It generally has more crema
            than an americano.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Macchiato</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The word “macchiato” means mark or stain. This is in reference to
            the mark that steamed milk leaves on the surface of the espresso as
            it is dashed into the drink. Flavoring syrups are often added to the
            drink according to customer preference.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Long Macchiato</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            Often confused with a standard macchiato, the long macchiato is a
            taller version and will usually be identifiable by its distinct
            layers of coffee and steamed milk.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Cortado</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The cortado takes the macchiato one step further by evenly balancing
            the espresso with warm milk in order to reduce the acidity.

        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The breve provides a decadent twist on the average espresso, adding
            steamed half-and-half to create a rich and creamy texture.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Cappuccino</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            This creamy coffee drink is usually consumed at breakfast time in
            Italy and is loved in the United States as well. It is usually
            associated with indulgence and comfort because of its thick foam
            layer and additional flavorings that can be added to it.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Flat White</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            A flat white also originates from New Zealand and Australia and is
            very similar to a cappuccino but lacks the foam layer and chocolate
            powder. To keep the drink creamy rather than frothy, steamed milk
            from the bottom of the jug is used instead of from the top.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Cafe Latte</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            Cafe lattes are considered an introductory coffee drink since the
            acidity and bitterness of coffee is cut by the amount of milk in the
            beverage. Flavoring syrups are often added to the latte for those
            who enjoy sweeter drinks.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Mocha</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            The mocha is considered a coffee and hot chocolate hybrid. The
            chocolate powder or syrup gives it a rich and creamy flavor and cuts
            the acidity of the espresso.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Vienna</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            There are a few variations on the Vienna, but one of the most common
            is made with two ingredients: espresso and whipped cream. The
            whipped cream takes the place of milk and sugar to provide a creamy
            texture.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Affogato</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            Affogatos are more for a dessert coffee than a drink you would find
            at a cafe, but they can add a fun twist to your menu. They are made
            by pouring a shot of espresso over a scoop of vanilla ice cream to
            create a sweet after-meal treat.

        <h3 style="text-align: center">Iced Coffee</h3>
        <div class="hovertext">
          <p>
            Iced coffees become very popular in the summertime in the United
            States. The recipes do have some variance, with some locations
            choosing to interchange milk with water in the recipe. Often,
            different flavoring syrups will be added per the preference of the
            customer.
